My journey to improve my logic thinking following the directions of Love Babar to maintain Git profile and Codeforces profile. 
My On-Campus Placements starts from July 2021 right now I am in my 5th Semester. I am pursuitng BTech in Information technology from Academy of Technology,Adisaptagram. 
All kind of sevice based companies visit our college and placement record is also good but not a single product based companies come so Off-Campus is the only route to take. 
Three main goals of mine this year would be building a strong resume and improving my coding and logical thinking ability. 

For strong Resume I thing main focuses would be-: 

1.TECHNICAL SKILLS   2.ONLINE PRESENCE (CODEFORCES / CODECHEF PROFILES)  3.STRONG PROJECTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES  4.INTERNSHIPS 

So lets see how much can I accomplish my goals. 
IF YOU ARE READING WISH ME LUCK!!!
